exp-lookit-stimuli-preview
==============================================

Overview
------------------

A frame that to explain any blinding procedures to parents, and offer them the option to preview
stimuli before the study. Two buttons are available to move on: one turns on video recording & shows
the stimuli previews (if the parent wants to preview stimuli), and one moves on to the next frame
that (if the parent declines).

What it looks like
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recording
~~~~~~~~~~

If ``doRecording`` is true, then the family is recorded while previewing stimuli if they choose to.
This is so that if you want to make sure the child didn't see stimuli ahead of the study you can check.

Specifying where files are
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several of the parameters for this frame can be specified either by providing a list of full URLs and file types, or
by providing just a filename that will be interpreted relative to the ``baseDir``. See the :ref:`expand-assets` tool that this frame uses.

More general functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is information specific to this particular frame. There may also be available parameters, events recorded,
and data collected that come from the following more general sources:

- the :ref:`base frame<base frame>` (things all frames do)
- :ref:`video-record`
- :ref:`expand-assets`


Example
----------------

.. code:: javascript

    "my-video-preview": {
        "kind": "exp-lookit-stimuli-preview",
        "doRecording": true,
        "skipButtonText": "Skip preview",
        "previewButtonText": "I'd like to preview the videos",
        "blocks": [
            {
                 "text": "During the videos, we'll ask that you hold your child over your shoulder like this, so that you're facing face away from the screen."
            },
            {
                "image": {
                    "alt": "Father holding child looking over his shoulder",
                    "src": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimberscott/placeholder-stimuli/master/img/OverShoulder.jpg"
                }
            },
            {
                "text": "This is because your child is learning from you all the time, and may pick up on even very small cues about what you think. But if you can't see the stimuli, we're definitely only measuring your child's own beliefs."
            },
            {
                "text": "If you'd like to see the videos your child will be shown, you can take a look ahead of time now. It's important that you preview the videos without your child, so that the videos will still be new to them."
            }
        ],
        "showPreviousButton": true,
        "baseDir": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimberscott/placeholder-stimuli/master/",

             "video": "cropped_book"
           },
           {
             "caption": "Your child will be looking at images like this, and we'll ask him or her to describe each one.",
             "image": "square.png"
           },
           {

Updating from deprecated frames
---------------------------------

Updating from separate exp-video-preview-explanation and exp-video-preview frames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you currently use separate ``exp-video-preview-explanation`` and ``exp-video-preview`` frames, you will need to update
to a single ``exp-lookit-stimuli-preview`` frame when updating the experiment runner. Follow the steps below to update.

1. Combine the two frames into one (pooling all the parameters), and change its kind to ``exp-lookit-stimuli-preview``.

2. Move the value of ``introBlock`` to be the first element of ``blocks``, and move the ``image`` to a new additional element,
   like this:

   .. code:: javascript

        "introBlock": {
            "text": "During the videos, we'll ask that you hold your child over your shoulder like this, so that you're facing face away from the screen."
        },
        "image": {
            "alt": "Father holding child looking over his shoulder",
            "src": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lookitcontents/exp-physics/OverShoulder.jpg"
        },
        "blocks": [
            {
                "text": "The reason we ask this is that your child is learning from you all the time. Even if he or she can't see where you're looking, you may unconsciously shift towards one side or the other and influence your child's attention. We want to make sure we're measuring your child's preferences, not yours!"
            },
            {
                "text": "If you'd like to see the videos your child will be shown, you can take a look ahead of time now. It's important that you preview the videos without your child, so that the videos will still be new to them."
            }
        ],
        ...

   would become:

   .. code:: javascript

        "blocks": [
            {
                "text": "During the videos, we'll ask that you hold your child over your shoulder like this, so that you're facing face away from the screen."
            },
            {
                "image": {
                    "alt": "Father holding child looking over his shoulder",
                    "src": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lookitcontents/exp-physics/OverShoulder.jpg"
                }
            },
            {
                "text": "The reason we ask this is that your child is learning from you all the time. Even if he or she can't see where you're looking, you may unconsciously shift towards one side or the other and influence your child's attention. We want to make sure we're measuring your child's preferences, not yours!"
            },
            {
                "text": "If you'd like to see the videos your child will be shown, you can take a look ahead of time now. It's important that you preview the videos without your child, so that the videos will still be new to them."
            }
        ],
        ...

3. Remove the ``text`` and ``prompt`` parameters. (If you had something important in there, move it to "blocks".)

4. Rename ``videos`` to ``stimuli``. Within ``stimuli`` change any properties named ``sources`` to ``video``, and change any properties
   named ``imgSrc`` to ``image``.

Suppose you started with the following two frames:

.. code:: javascript

    "my-preview-explanation": {
        "introBlock": {
            "text": "During the videos, we'll ask that you hold your child over your shoulder like this, so that you're facing face away from the screen."
        },
        "image": {
            "alt": "Father holding child looking over his shoulder",
            "src": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lookitcontents/exp-physics/OverShoulder.jpg"
        },
        "kind": "exp-lookit-preview-explanation",
        "skipButtonText": "Skip preview",
        "previewButtonText": "I'd like to preview the videos",
        "blocks": [
            {
                "text": "The reason we ask this is that your child is learning from you all the time. Even if he or she can't see where you're looking, you may unconsciously shift towards one side or the other and influence your child's attention. We want to make sure we're measuring your child's preferences, not yours!"
            },
            {
                "text": "If you'd like to see the videos your child will be shown, you can take a look ahead of time now. It's important that you preview the videos without your child, so that the videos will still be new to them."
            }
        ],
        "showPreviousButton": true
    },
    "my-preview-frame": {
        "id": "video-preview",
        "kind": "exp-video-preview",
        "text": "Here are the videos your child will see in this study. You can watch them ahead of time--please just don't show your child yet!",
        "prompt": "My child can NOT see the screen. Start the preview!",
        "baseDir": "https://url.com/",
        "videoTypes": ["webm", "mp4"],
        "videos": [
           {
             "caption": "User-facing text that appears below the video",
             "sources": "example_intro"
           },
           {
             "caption": "User-facing text that appears below the video",
             "imgSrc": "caterpillar_picture"
           }
         ]
    }

Following the steps above, you would end up with:

.. code:: javascript

    "my-preview-explanation": {
        "kind": "exp-lookit-stimuli-preview",

        "skipButtonText": "Skip preview",
        "previewButtonText": "I'd like to preview the videos",
        "blocks": [
            {
                 "text": "During the videos, we'll ask that you hold your child over your shoulder like this, so that you're facing face away from the screen."
            },
            {
                "image": {
                    "alt": "Father holding child looking over his shoulder",
                    "src": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kimberscott/placeholder-stimuli/master/img/OverShoulder.jpg"
                }
            },
            {
                "text": "This is because your child is learning from you all the time, and may pick up on even very small cues about what you think. But if you can't see the stimuli, we're definitely only measuring your child's own beliefs."
            },
            {
                "text": "If you'd like to see the videos your child will be shown, you can take a look ahead of time now. It's important that you preview the videos without your child, so that the videos will still be new to them."
            }
        ],
        "showPreviousButton": true,
        "baseDir": "https://url.com/",
        "videoTypes": ["webm", "mp4"],
        "stimuli": [
           {
             "caption": "User-facing text that appears below the video",
             "video": "example_intro"
           },
           {
             "caption": "User-facing text that appears below the video",
             "image": "caterpillar_picture"
           }
         ]
    }

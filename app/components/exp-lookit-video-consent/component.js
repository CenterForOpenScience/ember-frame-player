Video consent frame for Lookit studies, with consent document displayed at left and instructions to start recording, read a statement out loud, and send. A standard consent
document is displayed, with additional study-specific information provided by the researcher, in accordance with the Lookit terms of use.

Researchers can select from the following named templates:

`consent_001`: Original Lookit consent document (2019)
`consent_002`: Added optional GDPR section and research subject rights statement

To look up the exact text of the consent document, see https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer/blob/master/app/components/exp-lookit-video-consent/template.hbs

The consent document can be downloaded as PDF document by participant.

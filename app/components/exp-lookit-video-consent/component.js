/**
Video consent frame for Lookit studies, with consent document displayed at left and instructions to start recording, read a statement out loud, and send. A standard consent
document is displayed, with additional study-specific information provided by the researcher, in accordance with the Lookit terms of use.

Researchers can select from the following named templates:

`consent_001`: Original Lookit consent document (2019)
`consent_002`: Added optional GDPR section and research subject rights statement
`consent_003`: Same as consent_002 except that the 'Payment' section is renamed 'Benefits, risks, and payment' for institutions that prefer that

To look up the exact text of each consent template for your IRB protocol, please see https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/tree/master/Legal

The consent document can be downloaded as PDF document by participant.

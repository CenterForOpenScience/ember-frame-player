==============================================

Overview
------------------

A frame to display video instructions to the user.

A video is displayed to the left, and a transcript or summary in a scrolling box to the right. (The transcript can
be omitted if desired, but in that case you must provide complete captioning for the video!)

The participant is required to either scroll to the bottom of the transcript or watch the video to proceed.

Several of the parameters for this frame can be specified either by providing a list of full URLs and file types, or
by providing just a filename that will be interpreted relative to the ``baseDir``. See the :ref:`expand-assets` tool that this frame uses.

Spatial abilities are important for understanding objects, reading maps, mathematical reasoning, and navigating the world. Thus, the development of mental rotation is an important milestone. In the current study, we are interested in examining whether babies in general can mentally rotate simple objects."

The shapes appear and disappear, changing their orientation each time they reappear. On one side, the rotation will always be possible. Sometimes, on the other side, a mirror image of the shape will be presented. If babies can mentally rotate objects, they should spend different amounts of time watching these two kinds of stimuli."

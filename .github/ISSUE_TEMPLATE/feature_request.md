Note: This is the correct form to use for ideas that relate to the Lookit frameplayer: anything that would show up when participating in a Lookit study, e.g. a new type of frame, different formatting/ functionality/options on an existing frame, a new type of counterbalancing for longitudinal studies.  

If you have an idea for the participant or experimenter interfaces outside of actual studies, please [create a feature request in lookit-api](https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api/issues/new/choose) instead. (If you're not sure where your idea belongs, don't worry, we can move it :) )

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

**Is your feature request related to a particular frame?**
[E.g., exp-lookit-exit-survey, exp-lookit-observation]

**Describe your idea or solution**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered, or any problems you've anticipated that your idea might cause.

**Additional context**
If your idea might be useful to other researchers too, do you have any questions for them about how they'd prefer it be implemented?

If applicable, a sketch of how your new frame should look or a marked-up screenshot showing how you want something to change is **super** helpful!
